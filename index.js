// Task 4
const KEYCODES = {
  f: 70,
  enter: 13,
  left: 37,
  up: 38,
  right: 39,
  down: 40,
};

const bmoState = {
  speed: 100,
  showing: true,
  facingRight: true,
  top: 0,
  left: 0,
};
//  when teacher button is clicked, broadcast an alert saying "i like event."

//  when student button is clicked, make bmo disappear (use the opacity property)

// me: when the space bar is pressed, bmo should flip from right to left, then inside that function add movement to bmo if you press any of up and down, left,right, it will move that direction
//hint event has keyCode property if the key code equals to KEYCODES up property, it will decrease top as same speed as bmoState speed.
//bmoState.top -= bmoState.speed;
// bmoEl.style.top = bmoState.top + "px";

// you: make the flipping action toggle as well.

// me: up arrow moves bmo up by 10px (toPx)
// hint: bmo is absolutely positioned, so you can use the top, right, bottom & left properties at will.

// you: give bmo 4 directions of movement
